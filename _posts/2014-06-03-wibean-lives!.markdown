title: WiBean Lives!

After working on a side project for a few months with a friend I am finally ready to post some info on the web.  Espresso geeks get excited...

What is it?
----------
We call it the WiBean.  If making espresso with your normal machine isn't enough for you, then why not stick a microcontroller in there and control it with an app?  We thought that sounded like a great idea for a fun side project.

Features of the WiBean:

-  No more waiting for the espresso machine to heat up!  Set an alarm so your espresso machine is ready to make coffee when you are.  
-  Find the best temperature for every bean.  WiBean safely takes digital control of your espresso machines heating loop to allow for precise temperature control.
-  Design custom brewing programs.
-  Safety:  WiBean sits on top of the machines built-in physical safety system.  In the unlikely event something were to go wrong with the WiBean, the machine would simply operate as normal.  


The Story
----------
Early in 2014 I was contacted by my friend Stefan who is an electrical engineer about a side project he had been working on.  He was playing around hacking on his espresso machine and had made a first version of a circuit board, but he had no software or firmware.  Of course, an app to control everything would be the perfect compliment to his great hardware!  As he has many years of professional experience designing circuits which include safe handling of high voltage and high current, I decided it sounded like a great idea!  We have since taken an evening about once a week to work on the project and after a few months of side-hacking, put it all together and brewed our first coffee!


What's next?
-----------
At the moment the firmware for the Arduino is working, and an ultra-simple Android app for controlling it also works.  I am now going to work on porting the microcontroller piece over to the Spark.io chip (because it's smaller and it seems like a fun project).  Additionally, I am going to make a second version of the Android app which is user friendly and has more than 0 minutes put into design.


With projects like this there is an endless supply of further ideas for hacking.  So far here's a few on the list of possibilities...

- Water tank sensor
- Integration with a robot grinder and tamper
- Share your programs with your friends
- .... many more!
