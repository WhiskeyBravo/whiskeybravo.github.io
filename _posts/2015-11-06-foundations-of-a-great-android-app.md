##Introduction
Interested in creating an Android app for your company? From your latest idea?  Already have an app that you want to grow?  Consider the following steps to provide your app with a foundation for growth and success.  As of writing, the Android app ecosystem, and the associated [Play Store][1], powers over [1.5 billion][2] downloads a month.  Filtering out the best experiences from this provides some concrete recommendations to ensure your app is not just good, it is great.

####The first step
A great app starts not with code, but with a plan.  Before you engage a developer to write the first line of code, create a marketing plan which will drive the app development process.  If you already have an app, go through the process for your existing idea and see how your plan fits what you have today.  Creating a plan is essential for effectively marketing an existing app.

####Guiding principle
Focus on the user.  At any point in the design process ask, "what would provide the best user experience?"  in order to choose a path when at a fork in the road.

##Marketing Plan
####*Create* a title for your app
It should be one word, maximum two.  Keep your title short and relavent.  Make it less than 25 characters so your entire title will appear on the screen in an App Store.  Do not get too creative or people will not find it when searching!

####*Define* the 4 most relevant keywords for your app
Choosing keywords helps to define the essence of your app.  If after sometime you feel your keywords are not appropriate, choose new ones! and re-run the process from here.  Additionally, keywords are needed for listing your app in an app store and also on the web - so save these for later.

####*Who* is your audience?
Is your target a local market?  Multiple global markets?  This will be important for guiding both the visual and technical parts of your app.

####*Benchmark* your competitors
Now that these three key elements are defined, use this to search and find who are your largest competitors.  Using searches in app stores and on the web, use the keywords and target audience to list the competitors to your app.  If  searches using the keywords and audience defined earlier are returning different apps and companies, consider retargeting your keywords or audience.  If you are targeting a new market and have no competitors, include time and budget in your plan for creating the search and keyword presence for your app.  Sometimes being first comes with additional challenges.

Take the list of competitors and create a matrix containing their keywords, unique sellings points, and features.

####*When* is the app used?
Discuss when the app will be used.
* In a social setting?
YouTube is often used by a group of friends sitting around a TV with a Chromecast.  This an opportunity to include proximity based sharing features such as via NFC or Bluetooth. 
* While commuting?
News readers and aggregation apps are often used while communiting by train, bus, or plane.  Users may be more interested in the app content than opening social connections.  Consider including sharing features which allow the user to share the app with a friend or colleague at a later, scheduled time.  Consider how social and sharing actions may communicate to others what the user is doing or where they are.  If this could have a negative effect on the user, consider ways to remove this friction.
* At home or in a private experience?
Is the app attractive because it offers an escape from the day?  
This is important for effective advertising targeting as well as for understanding how the app will be shared.
